# What is Turtle??

Turtle is a library in Python.

# But wait...what's a library?

A library is a reusable set of code. Other programmers from all over create libraries that everyone can use. Turtle is an example of one such library!

In order to access the turtle library, we must include an import line, like so:
```
import turtle
```

This imports all of the code inside of the turtle library so that we can use it in our repl.
The next thing we want to do is save our turtle pen as a variable t so it's easier for us to code. For example:
```
t = turtle.Pen()
```

Now if I want to move my turtle forwars 100 pixels, I can simply write:
```
t.forward(100)
```

Navigate to the py file to practice using the turtle library!
